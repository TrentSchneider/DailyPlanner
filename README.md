# Daily Planner

Note: There is currently a known issue that the page may need to be refreshed in order for the entries to display when switching days.

## Description
This is a site demonstrating my abilities with JQuery and local storage. This site is a daily planner that can change dates. All entries in the planner can be saved and will still be there after the page is refreshed. Depending on the time of day, the planner will update the interface displaying what time of day has already passed, the current time of day, and future time of day.

## Installation
There is no installation needed as this will work with any browser.

## Usage
The user is given the option of entering text on any timeslot and hit save. Once save is hit, text will save on that timeslot for that day. The user is also given the ability to change the time of day by selecting the previous day, today, and next day buttons. The user can also select the clear button at the bottom of the page to remove all entries.

## Credits
Some code ideas for the final code is based on code from wikimass.com. All other code was created by Trenton Schneider. You can find Trenton's work on Gihub at https://github.com/TrentSchneider
